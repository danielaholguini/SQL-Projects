# Oracle PL/SQL-Procedures
These are some of the procedures I have developed in PL/SQL with the help of my team (Logic and processes were given by the Database Architect & PM, and I translated them into PL/SQL). 

[CREATE CREDIT REGISTRY PROCEDURE](https://github.com/danielaholguini/SQL-Projects/blob/main/CREATE%20A%20CREDIT%20REGISTRY.sql)

[CREATE MONTHLY PAYMENT DATES PROCEDURE](https://github.com/danielaholguini/SQL-Projects/blob/main/CREATE%20MONTHLY%20PAYMENT%20DATES%20%20PROCEDURE.sql)

[CALCULATE MONTHLY CHARGES PROCEDURE](https://github.com/danielaholguini/SQL-Projects/blob/main/CALCULATE%20MONTHLY%20CHARGES%20PROCEDURE.sql)

In this language, I also developed a hybrid application, which let users see their upcoming paychecks and request cash in advance. 
This is what it looks like from a phone:

# SQL Server - Report
This is an example of my work in SQL Server: a report file created in Visual Studio (SSRS Reporting Services). 
The report shows the total amount of FECI paid per month by a Financial Institution. (FECI is similar to taxes, which is why they need to inform the government).

This is how the report looks:

# SYBASE SQL - Queries
These are some queries I have written to retrieve data from a private Bank of Panama.

[CLIENT INFORMATION QUERY](https://github.com/danielaholguini/SQL-Projects/blob/main/CLIENT%20INFORMATION%20QUERY.sql)
[GENERAL QUERY](https://github.com/danielaholguini/SQL-Projects/blob/main/GENERAL%20QUERY.sql)
[EMPLOYEE PERMISSIONS QUERY](https://github.com/danielaholguini/SQL-Projects/blob/main/EMPLOYEE%20PERMISSIONS%20QUERY.sql)

I also performed Data Migration from a software called COBIS to Oracle APEX, a web-based application, with SYBASE SQL queries (No access to those at the moment.)

Clients information was brought to a new application.
