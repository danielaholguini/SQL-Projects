# Oracle PL/SQL-Procedures
These are some of the procedures I have developed in PL/SQL with the help of my team (Logic and processes were given by the Database Architect & PM, and I translated them into PL/SQL). 

[CREATE A CREDIT REGISTRY.txt](https://github.com/danielaholguini/SQL-Projects/files/8750429/CREATE.A.CREDIT.REGISTRY.txt)

[CREATE MONTHLY PAYMENT DATES  PROCEDURE.txt](https://github.com/danielaholguini/SQL-Projects/files/8750440/CREATE.MONTHLY.PAYMENT.DATES.PROCEDURE.txt)

[CALCULATE MONTHLY CHARGES PROCEDURE.txt](https://github.com/danielaholguini/SQL-Projects/files/8750442/CALCULATE.MONTHLY.CHARGES.PROCEDURE.txt)

In this language, I also developed a hybrid application, which let users see their upcoming paychecks and request cash in advance. 
This is what it looks like from a phone:

# SQL Server - Report
This is an example of my work in SQL Server: a report file created in Visual Studio (SSRS Reporting Services). 
The report shows the total amount of FECI paid per month by a Financial Institution. (FECI is similar to taxes, which is why they need to inform the government).

[Monthly FECI Payment.zip](https://github.com/danielaholguini/SQL-Projects/files/8750449/Monthly.FECI.Payment.zip)

This is how the report looks:

# SYBASE SQL - Queries
These are some queries I have written to retrieve data from a private Bank of Panama.

[CLIENT INFORMATION QUERY.txt](https://github.com/danielaholguini/SQL-Projects/files/8750453/CLIENT.INFORMATION.QUERY.txt)
[GENERAL QUERY.txt](https://github.com/danielaholguini/SQL-Projects/files/8750486/GENERAL.QUERY.txt)
[EMPLOYEE PERMISSIONS QUERY.txt](https://github.com/danielaholguini/SQL-Projects/files/8750487/EMPLOYEE.PERMISSIONS.QUERY.txt)

I also performed Data Migration from a software called COBIS to Oracle APEX, a web-based application, with SYBASE SQL queries (No access to those at the moment.)

Clients information was brought to a new application.
