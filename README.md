# Oracle PL/SQL-Procedures
These are some of the procedures I have developed in PL/SQL with the help of my team (Logic and processes were given by the Database Architect & PM, and I translated them into PL/SQL). 

[CREATE A CREDIT REGISTRY.txt](https://github.com/danielaholguini/SQL-Projects/files/8750429/CREATE.A.CREDIT.REGISTRY.txt)

[CREATE MONTHLY PAYMENT DATES  PROCEDURE.txt](https://github.com/danielaholguini/SQL-Projects/files/8750440/CREATE.MONTHLY.PAYMENT.DATES.PROCEDURE.txt)

[CALCULATE MONTHLY CHARGES PROCEDURE.txt](https://github.com/danielaholguini/SQL-Projects/files/8750442/CALCULATE.MONTHLY.CHARGES.PROCEDURE.txt)

# SQL Server - Report
This is an example of my work in SQL Server: a report file created in Visual Studio (SSRS Reporting Services). 
The report shows the total amount of FECI paid per month by a Financial Institution. (FECI is similar to taxes, which is why they need to inform the government).

This is how the report looks:

# SYBASE SQL - Queries
These are some queries in SYBASE SQL that I have written to query data from a private Bank of Panama.

[CLIENT INFORMATION QUERY.txt](https://github.com/danielaholguini/SQL-Projects/files/8750453/CLIENT.INFORMATION.QUERY.txt)

And a Migration Query (From a core called COBIS to Oracle APEX, a web-based application)
